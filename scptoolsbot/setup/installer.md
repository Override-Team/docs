# Installer

There's an installation script that is updated with every release. Just head to the latest release and download the `installer.sh`. After downloading the installer, give it the right permissions and execute it.

## Quick Install

You can quickly run the most current version of the script directly from master:

<pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"><strong>sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vxrpenter/SCPToolsBot/master/installer.sh)"
</strong></code></pre>

## Run from Release

When you download the script from the latest release you should give it the right execution permission and then run it:

<pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"><strong>chmod +x installer.sh
</strong>
sudo ./installer.sh
</code></pre>
